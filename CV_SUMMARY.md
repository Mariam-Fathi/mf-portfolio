# Portfolio Website Project Summary for CV

**Interactive Portfolio Website | Next.js, React, TypeScript, GSAP, Three.js**

A personal portfolio website born from extensive research, design exploration, and iterative refinement. Through researching UI/UX principles, gathering inspiration from Pinterest and leading portfolios, and investing countless hours of free time, I crafted a clean, breathing interface that feels authentically me. For me, this project is about the process and the journey—the research, iterations, and design thinking matter more than the technical stack alone. Built with Next.js, React, GSAP, and Three.js.
